Q2_pt1 = "Alfred Pennyworth: Just the way it was, sir? Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: They scream, and they cry, much as your doing now. Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: Having trouble? Take a seat. Have a drink. You look like a man who takes himself too seriously. Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up. Henri Ducard: If you make yourself more than just a man... if you devote yourself to an ideal...and if they cant stop you, then you become something else entirely. Henri Ducard: No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed, or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they cant stop you, then you become something else entirely. Batman/Bruce Wayne: And youll never have to Batman/Bruce Wayne: At least they gave us a discount. Ras Al Ghul: Gothams time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one weve performed for centuries. Gotham... must be destroyed. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Look, Mr. Fox. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Oh, Im sorry I didnt tell you, Rachel -- Batman/Bruce Wayne: Rachel, all- all this, it- its not me.. inside.. I am, I am more... [Bruces dates shouted: Come on, Bruce. We have some more hotels for you to buy.] I am batman!#"
Q2_pt2 = "Batman/Bruce Wayne: I brought mine. Batman/Bruce Wayne: As long as it takes. Im gonna show the people of Gotham their city doesnt belong to the criminals and the corrupt. Ras Al Ghul: No one can save Gotham. Ras Al Ghul: I warned you about compassion, Bruce. Batman/Bruce Wayne: In the southeast corner? Batman/Bruce Wayne: I wont kill you, but I dont have to save you Batman/Bruce Wayne: Escalation? Thomas Wayne: Why do we fall Bruce? So we can learn how to pick ourselves back up. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Bats frighten me. Its time my enemies shared my dread. Rachel Dawes: No, they are never the same. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better I am batman!#"
