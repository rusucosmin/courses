Q2_pt1 = "Alfred Pennyworth: Say, uh, Ten Thousand. Batman/Bruce Wayne: My parents deserve justice. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues. Alfred Pennyworth: Its a problem with the graphite, sir. The next 10,000 will be up to specifications. Lucius Fox: Uh-huh... and you expect to be shot a lot in these caves? Ras Al Ghul: Have you finally learned to do what is necessary? Jim Gordon: I never said thank you. Henri Ducard: No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed, or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they cant stop you, then you become something else entirely. Batman/Bruce Wayne: The man had a gun! Batman/Bruce Wayne: Its not who I am underneath, but what i do that defines me. Lucius Fox: Not at all, I just wanted you to know how hard it was. Bottomline I synthesised an antidote. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Look, Mr. Fox. Ras Al Ghul: Familiar. Dont you have anything new? Batman/Bruce Wayne: I wont kill you but I dont have to save you. Alfred Pennyworth: Quite. In the, uh, meantime, Sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head? Flass: I swear to God! I am batman!#"
Q2_pt2 = "Ras Al Ghul: Only a cynical man would call what these people have lives, Wayne. Crime, despair... this is not how man was supposed to live. The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years. We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence, we return to restore the balance. Rachel Dawes: Bruce, deep down you may still be that great kid you used to be, but its not who you are underneath, its what you *do* that defines you. Rachel Dawes: Its not who we are but what we do that defines us Henri Ducard: As you wish. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Which is? Ras Al Ghul: But... is Ras Al Ghul immortal? Or are his metods supernatural? Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: Would you like to see my mask? I use it in my experiments. Now, Im probably not very frightening to a guy like you. But these crazies, they cant stand it. Batman/Bruce Wayne: Im batman!! Henri Ducard: Men fear most what they cannot see. Batman/Bruce Wayne: [smiling] Does it come in black? Batman/Bruce Wayne: And you will never have to. I am batman!#"
