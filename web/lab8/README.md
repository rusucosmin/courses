#PHP & AJAX
- Write a web application which implements a guest book. A guest book record is identified by: author (email), title, comment, date.
A client of the application should be able to add new entries in the guest book, but only the administrator of the site can delete or
modify them. Also the administrator should be able to browse the list of guest book entries based on (grouped by) their author and title
using AJAX. Guest book browsing should be paged - entries are displayed on pages with maximum 4 entries on a page (you should be able to
go to the previous and the next page).
