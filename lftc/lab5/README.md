Parsing
Working time: 3 weeks
Delivery: lab.12
-------------------------------
One assignment is for a team of 2 students.
One of the following parsing methods will be chosen:
a. recursive descendent
b. ll(1)
*c. slr*
d. lr(1)
The assignment is divided in the following phases:
STEP 1: perform the parsing of an input sequence
Input: - a context free grammar (the example from course)
- an input sequence
Output: the parsing tree corresponding to the input sequence
or a message in case the sequence is not accepted.
The result will be any possible representation of the parsing tree
(including derivations string)
Remark: Verify if the parsing method can be applied.
STEP 2: parsing
performs the parsing for a program written in your language
(MLP lab. 1)
Input: PIF + minilanguage grammar
Output: parsing tree corresponding to the program
or a message for errors (error diagnose where it is the case)
If the grammar does not satisfy the conditions of the parsing algorithm,
consult your teacher!
